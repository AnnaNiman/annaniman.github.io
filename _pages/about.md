Anna Niman is a multidisciplinary artist from London who's work traverses
painting, photography, light-based installations and performance.

She was brought up in community
of artists in Camden and was exposed to the very different artistic disciplines
of her parents. Her mother -- a print maker and painter -- instilled in her a
fascination with observational drawing. Her father -- a multidisciplinary
surrealist artist who often worked with ready-mades -- inspired her to experiment
with many techniques and adopt a playful approach to different mediums. As a protege of
dancer/choreographer Hilde Holger, she deepened this experimental approach to
personal expression and expanded her repertoire to include movement and
time-based work. Anna Niman continues to draw upon these early experiences
in her current work and adopts a playful and experimental approach to each medium
she uses.

Anna Niman believes art should be fun, open and accessible to all. Since 2010,
she runs the weekly [London Art & Drawing](https://www.instagram.com/londonartdrawing/)
life drawing and portrait drawing sessions at different
locations in North London and online. She also runs art workshops on different
techniques.

Anna Niman studied fine art at Middlesex University and Byam Shaw School of Art.
She has taught art, photography, and time-based media at schools and colleges.
She taught dance at, and assisted the founder of, Hilde Holger's School of
Central European Expressionist
Contemporary Dance.
She was a member of the London Biennale, founded by David Medalla.
Her work has featured in venues such as Somerset House, the Royal Festival Hall,
Oxo Bargehouse, the Bourges film festival in France, and Berlin.
